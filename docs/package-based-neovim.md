# Package-based Neovim configuration structure

[English](package-based-neovim.md) | [한국어](package-based-neovim.ko.md)

`nvim-pack/.config/nvim-pack/init.lua` loads the feature modules directly from
`nvim-pack/.config/nvim-pack/lua/`. Snacks is configured before modules register its toggles.
It resolves its own file location, including symlinks, so `nvim -u /path/to/init.lua`
also works when the adjacent `lua/` directory is present.

***FLASH***'s `nvim/.config/nvim/init.lua` stays independent: it loads feature modules from its own
`lua/` directory and does not import any Package-based Neovim modules. Copy its whole profile directory
when moving it to a server. `vi` always starts ***FLASH***; `pvi` selects `NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-pack`. Package-based Neovim plugins and Mason tools are separate
from these configuration files and must also be available on a network-isolated server.

`ui.lua` passes the configuration from `bigfile.lua` to Snacks and calls the cached
terminal toggle from `terminal.lua` when an explorer terminal shortcut is pressed.
Snacks also manages capability-aware LSP keymaps, feature toggle bindings, and
filtered bulk buffer deletion. Sticky context, breadcrumbs, and statusline
rendering keep their existing implementations and default states.
Modules that use Snacks import the installed
`snacks` plugin directly. Configuration module names intentionally differ from
plugin entry points such as `snacks`.

Automatic editing and code-analysis features use `buffer_policy.allows(buf)`;
normal loaded buffers are eligible unless marked as large files. Manual source
operations that should remain available on large files can use `is_source(buf)`,
which also recognizes unloaded normal buffers for buffer lists and sessions.
Manual formatting follows the same protection limits as code analysis.
Use `guard(callback)` for code-analysis keymaps. Do not duplicate `large_file`
checks in feature modules. `bigfile.lua` detects size and edit growth, then calls
`restrict(buf)` once. The policy disables Snacks buffer features and emits
`PackBufferRestricted`; each feature owns its cleanup, including Git/LSP detachment,
pending requests, overlays and outline data. Check eligibility when an action runs
and when an asynchronous result arrives. Global defaults and other buffers stay unchanged.

Statusline breadcrumbs display the cached LSP document-symbol hierarchy without a
Dropbar dependency or indentation-based guesses. `<leader>Td` toggles them; clicking
a symbol jumps to its declaration line. Cursor movement and statusline redraws
never request symbols. File changes and LSP attachment changes refresh the cache;
disabling the feature or restricting/unloading a buffer cancels pending work.
Files without symbol support show only their path. Control-flow blocks appear only
when supplied as symbols by the language server; Dropbar's sibling menus are not
implemented. Python environment selection cancels superseded requests and drops
results after its source is unloaded, renamed or restricted.

New features must use `buffer_policy` for eligibility. Only `bigfile.lua` owns
large-file detection. Connect each plugin's filters, keymaps and cleanup;
a buffer flag alone does not automatically stop an external plugin.

***FLASH*** implements the same contract in its own `buffer_policy.lua`,
without importing Package-based Neovim modules or plugins. Plugin-free Vim keeps the equivalent `IsSource`,
`BufferAllows`, and `RestrictBuffer` helpers inside `.vimrc`. Their
`NopackBufferRestricted` event cancels affected automatic work and clears active
UI. All three profiles protect files exceeding 2 MiB, 50,000 lines, or a single
10,000-byte line. Detection on open and changed-range checks on edits share the
same limits; features may retain stricter workload budgets, such as native Git
sign diff limits. Protection lasts until the buffer is discarded. Buffer lists,
project browsing, and sessions still recognize protected or unloaded source buffers.

When investigating cursor lag, start with the events and callbacks in the relevant
feature module. File splitting does not itself change refresh frequency, introduce
lazy loading, or improve performance. Avoid re-sourcing individual modules during
a running session: their setup code registers mappings and events. Restart Neovim
after changes.

## Live sharing

Package-based Neovim installs [peerpad.nvim](https://github.com/Sunwook-Hwang/peerpad.nvim)
through `vim.pack`; `init.lua` calls its setup directly. It interoperates with ***FLASH***'s native live sharing.
`<leader>Ps` starts sharing, `<leader>Pj` joins, `<leader>Pq` disconnects, and
`<leader>Pi` shows session information. The commands are `:Peerpad`,
`:PeerpadJoin`, `:PeerpadStop`, and `:PeerpadStatus`.
Transport loads only when needed; discovery checks once per source-file read.
For disconnected servers, copy this package along with the other Package-based Neovim plugins.

Participants still need a TCP connection even when NFS exposes the same file.
Only the host saves the shared source file.

## Scope and profiling

Snacks Scope uses indentation without Treesitter. `[i` / `]i` jump to scope
edges; `ii` / `ai` select the inner / full scope in visual or operator-pending
mode (for example, `vii` or `dai`). Scope highlighting remains disabled.

The Lua profiler starts disabled. `<leader>Dp` starts/stops recording and opens
results when stopped; `<leader>DP` reopens results; `<leader>Dh` toggles profiling
highlights. Recording adds overhead and captures only supported Lua calls,
including Lua autocmd callbacks registered while recording.
