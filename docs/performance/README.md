# Editor performance comparisons

Experiments are kept on the `performance-comparison` branch, separate from the
normal configuration branch. No editor configuration is changed by the benchmarks.

## Compare by use case

There is no overall winner across these different feature sets. The existing
measurements are organized as:

1. FLASH vs pvi: both support LSP, but only the LSP-disabled common editing
   baseline was measured. Matched LSP workflows remain unmeasured.
2. FLASH vs vimrc: vimrc has no LSP, so FLASH's LSP was disabled to match
   ctags definition-navigation tasks in the same project with the same tool.
3. Protected large files: separate policy-dependent results, not full-feature
   performance. Vim's common editing values are retained as reference data.

Percentages use the unrounded raw medians and describe individual task costs,
not overall editor speed. The 77 launches comprise 63 common editing runs and
14 ctags runs; none measure an LSP-enabled workflow.

## Current configuration

- [Performance by use case](flash-pvi-vimrc.md) / [한국어](flash-pvi-vimrc.ko.md)
- [Raw results](flash-pvi-vimrc-results.json)
- [Ctags: FLASH vs vimrc](flash-vimrc-ctags.md) / [한국어](flash-vimrc-ctags.ko.md)
- [Ctags raw results](flash-vimrc-ctags-results.json)
- [Excluded initial setup experiment](unlocked-startup-exploratory-results.json)
  (individual plugin symlinks triggered installation repair; not used for rankings)

The current comparison uses configuration revision `584ff5a` and records installed
package revisions. FLASH is the default `vi` profile under `nvim/`; the older
reports call that profile `npvi` and use the former directory layout.

## Historical reports

Recovered from the private repository's `readme-revision` branch, commit
`e6e9fce300ec3a998730ddb8e9ae735fc20f07f4`. Reports and raw datasets are preserved
unchanged under `historical/`, without merging private configuration or Git history:

- [npvi vs pvi](historical/no-pack-speedmode.md) / [한국어](historical/no-pack-speedmode.ko.md)
- [Ctags: Vim vs npvi](historical/ctags-vim-vs-npvi.md) / [한국어](historical/ctags-vim-vs-npvi.ko.md)
- [npvi + Neovide vs VS Code](historical/npvi-vs-vscode.md) / [한국어](historical/npvi-vs-vscode.ko.md)

Compare values within a study. Fixtures, configurations, editor builds, timing
boundaries and UI automation differ between studies. Historical values are not
measurements of the current configuration, and none establish performance on an
older Linux server, NFS filesystem or SSH terminal.
