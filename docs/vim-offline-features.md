# Offline Vim 9.0+

[한국어](vim-offline-features.ko.md) · [Configuration](../vim/.vimrc) · [Neovim counterpart](nvim-offline-features.md)

One `.vimrc`, native Vimscript, **no third-party plugins, no plugin manager, no
Lua, no startup downloads**. Vim's bundled runtime supplies syntax highlighting,
filetype indentation, netrw, completion, diff, terminals, and popup windows.

## Start and install

```sh
vim -Nu /path/to/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc
```

The configuration requires Vim **9.0 or newer**, with `+timers`, `+job`,
`+channel`, `+popupwin`, and `+cryptv` (for `sha256()`). Use `vim --version` to
check the build; a Tiny/minimal build is insufficient. `+terminal` enables the
embedded terminal and lazygit popup. Neither Python nor Lua interpreter support
is required.

For the normal repository installation, run `./install_dotfiles.sh`; it links
`vim/.vimrc` to `~/.vimrc`, backing up a conflicting file. `./clean_dotfiles.sh`
removes that link. On a restricted server, copy just `vim/.vimrc` to `~/.vimrc`
and run `vim`. Existing `onvi` / `offvi` aliases continue to launch **Neovim**;
this configuration is launched with **`vim`**.

Caches, persistent undo, netrw state, and sessions are stored under
`~/.vim/offline`. Set `VIM_OFFLINE_DATA` before starting Vim to change this
directory. Third-party directories are excluded from `runtimepath` and
`packpath`, so an existing Vim plugin installation is not loaded.

## Editing and navigation

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `gcc` | Toggle the current line's comment; accepts a count |
| `gc` + motion | Toggle comments over a motion, e.g. `gcj` or `gcap` |
| Visual `gc` | Toggle comments on selected lines |
| `.` | Repeat the comment operation |
| `>>` / `<<` | Shift the current line right / left, including first-column Python comments |
| Visual `>` / `<` | Shift selected lines and keep the selection for repeated shifts |
| `Ctrl-s` | Save from Normal or Insert mode |
| `jk` | Leave Insert mode |
| `Ctrl-h/j/k/l` | Move between windows |
| `Alt-j/k` | Move the current line or selection down / up |
| `Ctrl-Space` | Request native word/tag completion |
| `Ctrl-n/p`, `Tab`, `Shift-Tab` | Move through completion candidates |
| `Enter` | Accept a selected completion; otherwise insert a newline |

Comments use the current filetype's `commentstring`. Brackets, quotes, and
backticks pair automatically; existing closers are skipped and Backspace removes
empty pairs. Syntax colors and indentation come from Vim's bundled runtime.
The theme is `retrobox` when bundled, otherwise `desert`.

## ctags instead of LSP

Install **Universal Ctags** on `PATH` (recommended). Exuberant Ctags is also
accepted; macOS's BSD `ctags` is not. Universal is preferred across `PATH`
candidates. An explicit executable can be supplied with `g:offline_ctags`.

| Key / command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `gd` | Build the project index if needed, then jump to the word's definition |
| `g Ctrl-t` | Return through Vim's tag stack (`Ctrl-t` is the terminal toggle) |
| `Space o` | Toggle the right-hand ctags outline |
| Outline `Enter`, `r`, `q` | Jump, refresh from the saved file, close |
| `:CtagsUpdate` | Rebuild the whole current project index |
| `:CtagsClearAll` | Remove managed tag caches |
| `:OfflineCancel` | Cancel background commands and the active picker |

The first completion request in a file indexes that saved file. Project
definition lookup builds a full index asynchronously; subsequent saves queue
incremental updates without cancelling an in-flight full build. Old definitions
from changed files are replaced, including removed symbols. Rebuild explicitly
after external deletions/renames. In Git projects the index includes tracked
and untracked files while respecting `.gitignore`. Outside Git, common build,
dependency, and virtual-environment directories are excluded. Available
languages depend on the installed ctags build; CUDA extensions use its C++ parser.

**ctags reads saved files.** It does not resolve types, references, imports, or
rename symbols semantically. It provides no diagnostics, semantic tokens, LSP
hover/signature help, code actions, or snippets. Those Neovim LSP features are
deliberately absent; `gD` and `K` retain Vim's native behavior. Files with embedded
newlines cannot be indexed by this line-oriented ctags integration.

## Interface, files, and search

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Space A` | Native dashboard; also appears on an empty interactive startup |
| Dashboard `j/k`, `Enter` | Select and run a menu item; letter keys also work |
| Dashboard `:` | Close the overlay and start an Ex command; `:q` exits when no other window exists |
| `Space` | Show a guide to actual Space mappings after the mapping timeout |
| `Space e` | Toggle netrw in a left sidebar |
| `Space f`, `Space Enter` | Find project files / Git-tracked files |
| `Space st`, `Space t` | Live text search / search the cursor word |
| `Space s/` | Search the saved contents of open files |
| `Space sr`, `Space sn` | Recent files / Vim configuration files |
| `Space sb`, `Space bp` | Buffer picker |
| `Space sc/sh/sp/sk` | Commands / help / themes / keymaps |
| `Shift-h/l`, `[b` / `]b`, `Alt-1` … `Alt-9` | Switch buffers |
| `Space bw`, `Space c` | Close buffer / force-close buffer, keeping split frames |
| `Space bm`, `Space bh/bl` | Close other buffers / buffers to the left or right |
| `Space bj/bk`, `Space bD/bL` | Reorder buffers / sort by directory or language |
| `Space Ti` | Toggle indent guides (on by default) |
| `Space Ts` | Toggle Sticky Scroll (off by default) |
| `Space TS` | Toggle animated paging (off by default) |
| `Space Tl` | Toggle ctags/formatter status information |

Pickers use native fuzzy matching, a preview, `Ctrl-n/p` or arrow keys to select,
`Enter` to open, `Esc` to close, and `Ctrl-q` to send matches to quickfix. Text
search uses `rg` when available, otherwise `grep`. File discovery uses `find`.

netrw supports Enter/`l`, `h`, `-`, `o/v/t`, `%` (create a file in the editor),
`d`, `D`, `R`, `mf`, `mu`, `mt`, `mc`, `mm`, and `Space nr`. Copy/move requires
the system `cp`/`mv` commands. Destructive actions use the resolved tree path;
ambiguous decorated names are refused. Refresh stays inside the existing tree.
Use `:Ntree /path` or `gn` in the tree to set its root manually.

Project roots match offvi: Git/project markers for ordinary source,
the package directory inside `site-packages`/`dist-packages`, and the Python
standard-library directory identified by `os.py` plus `importlib/__init__.py`.
This does not hard-code a Python version.

Sticky Scroll uses the same bounded indentation-based heuristic as offvi,
including multiline Python function signatures. It preserves source line
numbers, the sign/number gutter, indent guides, and native syntax colors.
It shows at most eight scope lines; overflow keeps the outermost scope and
enclosing function, then nearby inner scopes. It is not a language parser and
may be incomplete in irregularly indented code or scopes beginning more than
1,000 lines above the viewport.

The active status line shows a mode-colored Git branch, filename, ctags and
formatter availability, filetype, and padded position. Inactive windows show
only filename and filetype. `[CTAGS X]` / `[FORMAT X]` means no supported tool was
found. Installing an executable does not add unsupported filetypes automatically.

## Git, formatting, sessions, and terminal

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Space gg` | 90% × 90% lazygit popup if installed; otherwise native Git status split |
| `Space gd/gD` | Diff the editable buffer against the index / HEAD in a separate tab |
| `Space gn/gp` | Next / previous changed hunk |
| `Space gb` | Toggle inline blame (off initially, 150 ms delay) |
| `Space sg` | Recent commit log |
| `Space lf` | Format asynchronously; never automatically on save |
| `Space u` | Preview undo states, then apply the selected state |
| `Space pr/pl/pS/pd` | Restore directory session / last session / pick session / stop saving |
| `Ctrl-t` | Toggle the reusable bottom terminal split (`+terminal`) |
| Terminal `Esc Esc` or `Ctrl-w N` | Enter Terminal-Normal mode; `i` returns to terminal input |

Git signs include **unsaved** changes on Vim 9.0, using asynchronous snapshot
diffs. Cached index contents are reused while typing and refreshed on file
entry/save, focus return, or shell completion. Neither cursor movement nor
status-line redraw launches Git commands. Inline blame is a noninteractive
end-of-line popup, compatible with Vim 9.0 without virtual-text support; it is
hidden while editing modified contents. Closing either diff pane returns to the
original editing tab without changing its window settings.

Formatters are searched on **PATH, then existing Neovim Mason binaries**; Vim
never installs them. Python prefers Ruff, then Black. Other registrations match
offvi: StyLua; clang-format for C/C++/CUDA/Proto; Prettier for JS/TS/React,
HTML/CSS/SCSS/Less, JSON/JSONC, YAML, Markdown/MDX, GraphQL, Vue, Handlebars;
Buildifier for Bazel; shfmt for Shell; cmake-format; latexindent for TeX; rustfmt.
MLIR has no standalone formatter registration. There is no LSP-format fallback.
Late formatter output is discarded if the buffer changed or was renamed.

Local desktop yanks use Vim's system clipboard when supported. SSH/default
terminal yanks use OSC52 plus `base64`, including tmux wrapping; the client
terminal must permit OSC52. This is **copy to the client**, not a remote read of
the client clipboard. Paste using the terminal's paste shortcut.

Large files disable expensive automatic features at 2 MiB / 50,000 lines.
Git signs and sticky scanning have lower byte limits, signs are capped at 2,000,
and background commands have time/output limits. Complex mixed Git hunks use
coarse added/changed classification to bound UI-thread work; changed ranges remain visible.
Formatter work, indexing, and
Git commands run asynchronously. Caches are tied to edits and lifecycle events,
not arbitrary expiration timers.
